We will rely primarily on three books in this section of the Introduction to Big Data course.

1. [The Art of Immutable Architecture][]
2. [Learning Spark, 2nd ed][]
3. [Functional Programming in Scala, 2nd ed][]

Students are not required to purchase hard copies of these books, but should at least have access to electronic versions of them.  Fortunately, a hard copy of the first book costs only about $35 on Amazon, and electronic copies of the other books are available for free.

The rest of this page contains more information about these books, as well as others that you might find useful to supplement your learning.

You should **not** buy the book from Amazon just yet, as you may
end up with the first edition, which does not cover Scala 3.

**Title**. [The Science of Functional Programming](https://leanpub.com/sofp)  
**Author**. Sergei Winitzki  
**Year**. 2021  
**ISBN**. 9780359768776  
**Source code**. [github.com/winitzki/sofp](https://github.com/winitzki/sofp)  
**Description**. This book is a pedagogical in-depth tutorial and reference on the functional programming paradigm. Starting from issues found in practical coding, the book builds up the theoretical intuition, knowledge, and techniques that functional programmers use for for rigorous reasoning about types and code. The book's topics include working with collections; recursive functions and types; the Curry-Howard correspondence; laws, structural analysis, and code for functors, monads, and other typeclasses; techniques of symbolic derivation and proof; parametricity theorems; and free type constructions. Detailed explanations and derivations are accompanied by solved examples tested in the Scala interpreter, as well as exercises and discussions that further build upon each chapter's material. The difficulty of this book's mathematical material is at the level of high-school calculus.
